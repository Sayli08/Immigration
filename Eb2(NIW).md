- An EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) I-140 petition is a request to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an Employment-Based Second Preference immigrant visa.
- What makes it unique is that it includes a waiver of the required PERM labor certification.
- This waiver is granted because the foreign national applying believes their work or contributions are in the national interest of the United States.
- We showed it both through in combination of past achievement as well as future perspective.

# Prongs

- Throughout the process, we want to demonstrate the three prongs. 
A] So the first prong is to propose endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance. 
B] Second, you are well positioned to advance this endeavor and 
C] Third it would be beneficial for the US to waive the labor certification requirements.

# Qualification

1] Advanced Degree: This typically means holding a master's degree or a higher academic degree (like a Ph.D.). As we discussed, a master's degree generally satisfies this on its own.
2] Exceptional Ability: This is defined as having a degree of expertise significantly above that ordinarily encountered in the sciences, arts, or business.1 One way to demonstrate exceptional ability is by having a bachelor's degree plus at least five years of progressive post-baccalaureate experience in your field


# Strategy for describing and framing your current work in your EB-2 NIW petition to demonstrate the first prong: that your proposed endeavor has substantial merit and national importance. 
USING CET LIST 

- Introduce and define the core area of your current work. It emphasizes being specific rather than using broad terms like just "technology" or "computer science." By focusing on "data privacy," "data security," and "cybersecurity technology," and even more specifically on "privacy-enhancing technologies," you're pinpointing a field that has clear relevance to national security and economic well-being in the digital age
- Need to provide concrete details about your actual work. It's not enough to just state the field. You need to describe the specific projects you're involved in, the tasks you undertake, and the different aspects of these technologies that you work with. This provides substance and shows USCIS the tangible nature of your contributions.
- Emphasizes the importance of connecting your current work to your background and expertise. By briefly mentioning your past experiences and how they've shaped your current skills and focus, you establish a trajectory and demonstrate that you have a solid foundation for your current endeavors. This adds credibility and shows that your current work is not an isolated effort but rather the result of accumulated knowledge and experience.

**In simpler terms, the comment is advising you to:**

- Clearly and specifically state the field of your current work, focusing on areas like data privacy, security, and especially privacy-enhancing technologies.
- Provide detailed explanations of what you actually do within that field, including your projects and responsibilities.
- Briefly mention your relevant past experiences and expertise that have brought you to this point in your career.

The goal of this approach is to paint a clear and compelling picture for USCIS of your work's relevance and your qualifications, directly addressing the first prong of the National Interest Waiver requirements. By being specific and providing context, you make a stronger case that your endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance.
